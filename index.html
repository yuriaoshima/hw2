        <h4>What Problems are Solved by Using Responsive Web Design?</h4>
        <p>Before responsive web design, viewing desktop sites on a mobile device usually led to a poor user experiences. Users would have to pinch and zoom to find what they needed on the desktop site when accessing it on a smaller mobile device. One solution to this problem was to create a separate site, complete with its own set of code, for mobile devices. However, even this solution came with its problems. The first of which was the hassle of maintaining two sites. The second being that whenever the link for the mobile site was shared on social media, users viewing it on a desktop site would see a tiny version of the site and end up with a bad experience. The good news is the modern utilization of responsive web design fixes all of this. With responsive web design, there is no need to define minimum screen size or create two or more sets of code to support your website on multiple devices. In fact, there are so many different devices and screen sizes today, that to maintain a different code set for each of them would be impossible. Instead, responsive web design uses flexible grids, flexible media, and CSS media queries to create web sites that are flexible and adaptable so that they can be viewed beautifully on any device of any screen size. With responsive web design, there is no longer a need to create separate sets of code for different devices. Instead, responsive web design utilizes flexible tools such as rems and grids to provide a rewarding user experience anywhere, on any device. Responsive web design can even help business revenue, since users are more likely to use a site that adapts to which ever device they are viewing it on. All in all, responsive web design is the modern solution in a world where the number of devices to view a single website on is endless.</p>
